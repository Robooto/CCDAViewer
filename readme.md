<h2>Implementation</h2>
core.js: C-CDA specific processing is carried out in core.js.

xslt.js: a javascript library that performs xsl transformations in the browser. A transformation requires two input strings, an xml and xsl string. Both must be well formed xml.
<p>The xslt.js library was updated as it would not work in IE11.</p>
The transformation is carred out in core.js:

<code>
new Transformation().setXml(cdaxml).setXslt('cda.xsl').transform("viewcda");
</code>

cdaxml: xml string that is set in the script.
cda.xsl: local xsl file.
viewcda: target div

XSL: cda.xsl is an extension of ANSI/HL7 CDAR2, v.3 (cda.xsl), which provides provision of narrative content. The extensions allow the dynamic layout functionality.
